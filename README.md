# Pose-audio


Another Hubert Sia and Nadia Abdul Aziz's fun project :)

Have you ever wonder that you can use your body pose to make sounds?

This Teachable Machine that detects different human poses. Each predefine poses triggers a sound effect.

Here are the different classification poses:

 - T-Pose
 - Left arm up
 - Right arm up
 - Cross
 - Squat
 - Pointing
 
 Additionally, the following two classes were added:
 
 - Idle
 - None
 
 The model was trained on 60-120 images per classes for both the main classification and the extra.
